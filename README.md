![logo-animated](https://github.com/rysk-finance/Rysk-Grant-Proposals/assets/8145692/a72e58e2-5236-41d7-96b4-af94e66de2aa)

At rysk, the core principle is collaboration over competition. As part of this commitment anyone is welcome to apply for a grant.

At this stage grants will be awarded to projects that are focused on increasing Rysk trading volumes. A committee composed by the Rysk's core team will be in charge to approve or reject Grant proposals.

## Ideas
We are open to ideas and proposals as long as the main goal is to increase Rysk trading volumes. We like to be surprised so feel free to propose your idea! 

There are, however, some projects that weâ€™re very interested in seeing. Below are some of the project ideas:
- Build strategies to use options to hedge
- Build automated options strategies or structured products that trade with Rysk. 
- Build a trading bot that enables anyone to trade options with a simplified UX (e.g. Telegram bot)
- Build app to trade with Rysk protocol that gamify options trading
