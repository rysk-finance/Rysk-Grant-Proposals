# Rysk Python Client

## Project Overview

### Overview
- A python client which can be used to interact with the Rysk network, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying protocol.
- A python client available on PyPi, which can be installed with `pip install rysk-client`
- This will enable a wider range of developers to build on top of Rysk, as they will not need to learn the underlying protocol.
- This will also enable developers to build on top of Rysk in a wider range of languages, as they will be able to use the python client as a reference implementation.
- This will enable us to build a wider range of applications on top of Rysk, as we will not need to continually re-implement the underlying protocol calls in python.

### Project Details
The project is already underway, and can be found at both of the following links:
- [Github](https://github.com/8ball030/rysk_explorations)
- [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/rysk-client/)

The client is based on the popular interace [ccxt](https://pypi.org/project/ccxt/), which is used to interact with a wide range of cryptocurrency exchanges. This means that the client will be familiar to a wide range of developers, and will be easy to use. The client is currently able to:

- Create long and short positions
- close positions
- redeem positions
- settle positions
- check balances
- check position status
- fetch markets
- fetch orderbook
- fetch dhv

### An overview of the technology stack to be used

A python client has been implemented as it is a popular language for developers, and is easy to use. The client is based on the popular interace (ccxt)[https://pypi.org/project/ccxt/], which is used to interact with a wide range of cryptocurrency exchanges. This means that the client will be familiar to a wide range of developers, and will be easy to use. The client is available on PyPi, and can be installed with `pip install rysk-client`

### Team / Contributor
The project is being developed by 8ball030, who is a developer with experience in python, solidity, and web3. The best way to get in contact is via twitter (@8baller11), or via email (8ball030@gmail.com).

## Development Status
- The project is already functional and can be used.

## Development Roadmap
- The project requires better documentation.
- The project requires more tests.
- The project requires more examples.

### Cost Overview
- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project 4 weeks.
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in 2750.00 USD

## Future Plans
Please include here:
- I intend to use the client personally in order to develop trading strategies on top of Rysk utilising the python client and the autonolas stack.
- I intend to provide ongoing support to users of the library and to the Rysk team in the form of bug fixes and feature requests.
- I intend to promote the library to the wider python community, and to the wider Rysk community.
- I intend to use the library as a reference implementation for other language clients, such as a javascript client as has been discussed in the discord.
